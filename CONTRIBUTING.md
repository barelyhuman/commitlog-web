# Contributing 
I don't have a lot of fluff to add so here's simple rules to contributing to the project.

This is divided into the following sections 
- [Bugs / Issues ](#bugs-and-issues)
- [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
- [Dev Flow](#dev-flow)
- [Licensing](#licensing)

## Bugs and Issues
- Use the templates to report a bug and make sure you fill as much detail as possible to help reproduce the bug.

## Pull Requests
- There's no standard template for pull requests but you could use something like [commiglog](https://github.com/barelyhuman/commitlog) or `git shortlog` to create a change report for the pull request, this helps me identify what all was solved in that PR. Try to keep them small and to the point of the actuall issue that the PR is for.

## Dev Flow
- Fork the repo 
- Make fixes
- Add tests if you can
- Generate change logs
- Create a PR, paste that changelog

## Licensing
Most projects are on MIT License and will stay on it. So by contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under it.
